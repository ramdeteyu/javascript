## Step 1: Download the password file
 
Before you can install AutoCAD 2013, you need to download a password file that will unlock the setup file. You can download the password file from one of these links:

After you download the password file, open it with a text editor and copy the password. You will need it later to extract the setup file.
 
## Step 2: Download the setup file
 
Next, you need to download the setup file for AutoCAD 2013. You can download it from this link:

- [AutoCAD 2013 Free Trial](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/free-trial)

The setup file is a compressed ZIP file that contains the installation files for AutoCAD 2013. You need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. When you extract it, you will be asked to enter the password that you copied from the password file. Enter the password and click OK.
 
## Step 3: Install AutoCAD 2013
 
After you extract the setup file, you will see a folder called AutoCAD\_2013\_English\_Win\_64bit. Open this folder and double-click on the file called Setup.exe. This will launch the installation wizard for AutoCAD 2013.
 
Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose the installation type (typical or custom), select the components and features that you want to install, and enter your product key and serial number. You can find your product key and serial number in the email that you received from Autodesk when you downloaded the trial version.
 
After you enter your product key and serial number, click Next and wait for the installation to finish. It may take some time depending on your system configuration and internet speed.

Once the installation is done, you need to activate AutoCAD 2013 to use it without any limitations. You can activate it online or offline.

Then follow the instructions on the screen to complete the activation process.
